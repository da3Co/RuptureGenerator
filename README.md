# RuptureGenerator
A library to create realistic seismic ruptures


RuptG.py file contains the functions and code to perform the rupture generations.

File Example1.py shows, as an example, how to create a single realization in a sequence process. 
File Example2.py shows the generation in parallel of several realizations for an earthquake using RuptG.py functions.

LectorFuente.py and LectorFuenteTot.py plot the main features of each generated rupture.
