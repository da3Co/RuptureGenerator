# RuptureGenerator
A library to create realistic seismic ruptures


RuptG.py file contains the functions and code to perform the rupture generations.

To present the function of RuptG.py the files Examples, show practicale ways to use RupG.py on different applications:

  File Example1.py: it shows, as an example, how to create a single realization in a sequence process. 
  File Example2.py: it shows the generation in parallel of several realizations for an earthquake using RuptG.py functions.
  File Example3.py: it takes an initial description and enhance the High frequency part of it to generate several realizations.
  
LectorFuente.py and LectorFuenteTot.py plot the main features of each generated rupture.
